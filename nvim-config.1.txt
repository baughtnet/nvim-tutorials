Configuration in neovim can be very modular.  To start with, we will have a single file config, called 
"init.lua".  Later on we will change our configuration to be more modular.  Either way will function fine, but 
keeping it modular makes it more organized and easier to work with later on.  Neovim can be configured using 
either vimscript or lua, we will be using lua to write our config.

## WHAT IS LUA?

Lua is a lightweight, high-level scripting language known for its simplicity.  It is a general purpose 
programming language that can be used for a wide variety of applications.  Lua is used in many different
has become a popular scripting language and is used in many other applications as well.  With lua and neovim
we will be able to control everything from key-mappings, appearance, and even modern language tools and features.

## GETTING STARTED

Open up your init.lua file that you created in the previous step(nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.lua).

Start by adding the follwing lines to your configuration file:

---

vim.o.number = true
vim.o.relativenumber = true
vim.o.wrap = false
vim.o.showmode = false

vim.o.tabstop = 4
vim.o.shiftwidth = 4
vim.o.expandtab = true
vim.o.smartindent = true

vim.o.clipboard = "unnamedplus"

---

The above lines set some basics for neovim.  Below is a more comprehensive list of options you can set, 
it also includes some explanation of each of the options above.

Start by copying the aboves lines in your configuration and then save and quit.  Re-open neovim and make
sure everything was set without any errors.  If everything worked, feel free to play and experiment with
with some of the other options below or look up "basic neovim settings" on the internet.

## BASIC NEOVIM SETTINGS

-- Basic Settings
vim.cmd[[syntax enable]]                -- Enable syntax highlighting
vim.cmd[[filetype plugin indent on]]    -- Enable file type detection, plugins, and indentation

vim.o.number = true                     -- Display line numbers
vim.o.relativenumber = true             -- Show relative line numbers
vim.o.wrap = false                      -- Disable line wrapping
vim.o.showmode = false                  -- Hide the mode indicator

-- Indentation and Formatting
vim.o.tabstop = 4                       -- Number of spaces a tab counts for
vim.o.shiftwidth = 4                    -- Number of spaces to use for each step of autoindent
vim.o.expandtab = true                   -- Use spaces instead of tabs
vim.o.smartindent = true                 -- Enable smart indenting

-- Search and Highlight
vim.o.incsearch = true                  -- Enable incremental search
vim.o.hlsearch = true                   -- Highlight search results
vim.o.ignorecase = true                 -- Case-insensitive search
vim.o.smartcase = true                  -- Case-sensitive if search pattern has uppercase characters

-- Mouse and Clipboard
vim.o.mouse = "a"                       -- Enable mouse support
vim.o.clipboard = "unnamedplus"         -- Use system clipboard

-- Backup and Swap Files
vim.o.backup = false                    -- Disable backup files
vim.o.swapfile = false                  -- Disable swap files

-- Miscellaneous
vim.o.hidden = true                     -- Allow hidden buffers
vim.o.showcmd = true                    -- Show partial command in status line
